As a team we used code with me on intellij to all code at the same time.  We worked with heavy collaboration letting each other know when we were overwhelmed and could not finish.
We often worked as a whole team together and when that was not possible we chose specific pieces of code to work on until each time we met.  Work was divided equally as we mostly worked together.

Rygl = javafx controllers and part logic
Tim = javafx controllers and test cases
Blaise = javafx ui and part backend
Sami = user backend and backend logic
