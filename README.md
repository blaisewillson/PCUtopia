# PCUtopia
PC utopia software enginnering project

To run the program run the PCUtopia.jar file.  If that does not build then you may have to clone the repo into a javafx intellij project and run it there.  
It depends on javafx and hansolo libraries.

The artifact jar was too big to be pushed to github the download is here:
